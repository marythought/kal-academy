# Bit manipulation:
#
# 1. Given an array that contains numbers from 1 to n-1 and exactly 1 duplicate, find that duplicate using bit operations.
#
# 2. Find the number of on(1) bits in a given number. For example, numbr 5 has 2 bits that are 1. Number 7 has 3 bits that are on.
#
# 3. Subtract two numbers without using arithmetic operators
#
# 4. How to turn off a particular bit in a number?
#
# 5. Swap two nibbles in a byte.
#
# 6. Swap all odd and even bits.
#
# 7. Binary representation of a given number
# 
# 8. Given an array where every element occurs three times, except one element which occurs only once. Find the element that occurs once. Expected time complexity is O(n) and O(1) extra space. Examples:
#
# Input: arr[] = {12, 1, 12, 3, 12, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3}
#
# Output: 2
